# Pokedex

This is a project I worked on during my first year of studying T level software development. It is a pokedex software where users can make accounts, set their own party of pokemon and search for pokemon by their pokedex ID or name.





## Features

- Account creation, renaming, password changing and deletion
- Searching for pokemon by name or pokedex ID
- Displays pokemon details
- Users can set their own party of pokemon, allowing party members to be replaced aswell
- Password hashing using sha256
- Regular expression to ensure passwords are secure
